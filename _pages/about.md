About me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.life.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of Life Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>, focusing on <b>AI in medicine</b>, <b>computational neuroscience</b>, and <b>medical image analysis</b>.

<span style="font-size:20px; text-decoration:underline;"><b>
I actively seek long-term clinical collaborations in areas such as
<span style="color:red;">neuroimaging</span>, 
<span style="color:red;">pan-cancer studies</span>, 
and <span style="color:red;">osteonecrosis of the femoral head!</span></b>
